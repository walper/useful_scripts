    - the first column should be the word
    - the second column should be the definition
Note that the word list doesn't have to be sorted alphabetically. The script will sort it for you.
output file:
    - a text file for each letter of the alphabet
    - the file name is output_letter_{letter}.txt
    - the file content is a list of words and definitions separated by a semicolon
    - the words and definitions are separated by a pipe
    - the words and definitions are sorted alphabetically
